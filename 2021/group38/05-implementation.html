                Since our main task is to implement an AR Pet Assistant, it is
                natural to think of Unity. Unity platform allows making
                real-time 3D projects for Games, Engineering, Film, etc. [1],
                and it is also one of the best tools for XR development [2]. C#,
                backed by Microsoft [3], is the language supported by Unity for
                developers.

                There are four major AR SDKs today: ARKit, ARCore, Vuforia and
                AR Foundation. All SDKs are integrated in Unity game engine [4].

                AR Foundation: A framework purpose-built for AR development
                allows you to develop your app once, then deploy it across
                multiple mobile and wearable AR devices. It includes core
                features from each platform, as well as unique Unity features
                that include photorealistic rendering, physics, device
                optimizations, and more. AR Foundation is a good AR development
                tool for games and lightweight solutions.

                Vuforia: As a leader in the AR/MR space, PTC’s Vuforia is a
                great development system for business-oriented projects,
                especially manufacturing AR solutions. The program’s flexible
                development engine has already been used for creating innovative
                workflows in multiple industries. Vuforia collaborates with
                Unity to help developers use augmented reality as a
                cross-platform SDK for Android, iOS, UWP and digital eyewear. It
                can use images and real objects as targets for placing content

                AR Kit and AR Core: ARKit is the go-to application for the
                development of AR software developed by Apple, so it is not
                possible to use ARKit on android phones. ARCore is in many ways
                an analog of ARKit – another application developed by the
                creators of a platform for devices using this platform. In this
                case, the company is Google, and the platform is Android.

                SLAM AR: SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.
                It is a technology which understands the physical world through
                feature points. This makes it possible for AR applications to
                Recognize 3D Objects & Scenes, as well as to Instantly Track the
                world, and to overlay digital interactive augmentations. We need
                to apply this technology so that pets can understand and move in
                user’s room.

                Recommender system: A recommender system, or a recommendation
                system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as
                platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering
                system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user
                would give to an item [7]. One approach to the design of
                recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative
                filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption
                that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and
                that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the
                past. The system generates recommendations using only
                information about rating profiles for different users or items.
                By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to
                the current user or item, they generate recommendations using
                this neighborhood.

                Pokémon Go is one of the most famous and earliest AR games, and
                it has similarities with AR part of our project. In Pokémon Go,
                users catch and collect Pokémon under AR mode. It encourages
                users to go out by integrating Google Map API within, so that
                the more places user discovered, the more Pokémon he will
                collect, the more powerful he will be. They can train it by
                having combat with other trainers, interacting with them or
                feeding them to increase intimacy. Likewise, in WAPETS2.0 users
                can interact, play and feed their WAPETs under AR mode, and
                there will be intimacy system and social media integration. Many
                researchers suggests that Pokémon GO reduced anxiety about
                interacting with strangers [8], Pokémon GO increases
                attention-concentration in adolescents and players feel more
                happy than non-players [9], and help to build social
                connectedness through real-world engagement [10]. We have reason
                to hope that WAPETS2.0 can bring such a positive impact to
                society as well.
