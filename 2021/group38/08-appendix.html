                Our project is owned and will be operated by UCL and IBM, and

              <p class="card-text">
                Our project makes use of a login system that stores and
                processes user email addresses, which may include usernames
                and/or surnames and/or other user information, and user
                passwords. Our application will not keep or expose any data
                (usernames, emails, passwords, user searches and user
                preferences) that have been sent, stored and/or uploaded by
                users after the users finish using it. The application is
                expected to be accessed and used by any legal citizens, without
                discrimination towards any of the users that may want to use it
                based on gender, race, religion etc.

                We’ve taken the necessary steps to ensure privacy and data
                protection in our project. We’ve set our GitHub repository to
                private to disallow any confidential information, whether it be
                user information, token information or source code to be leaked.
                This also ensures that the data is not shared to anyone that is
                not directly involved in the development of our project.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                To ensure user’s data safety, we can ensure users that we use
                appropriate methods to process the data that may be sent by
                users. No data is sent or sold to any other company,
                organisation (profit or non-profit) other than those covered
                under the IP statement. The web server used to store user
                information uses Python’s Django framework to send and receive
                information from and to the web server, ensuring that our data
                is processed as it is intended to.

                Our project uses speech processing through IBM’s Watson
                toolchain to process certain user commands. None of the user
                voice commands are stored, sent or processed in any way. We can
                ensure users that their biometric information is not stored in
                any way and is used in accordance with the GDPR to only process
                commands that the user instructs the application to perform.

              <p class="card-text">
                Finally, we ensure that our program only processes data that is
                necessary for the minimum functionality of our project, namely
                the login screen. Other user data such as keystrokes, search
                inputs, mouse clicks and any other type of user input and/or
                user-specific information is not processed in any way by our
                application. End users can be ensured that their data will only
                be processed in the abovementioned methods, and any changes that
                may occur will be informed to them and will be asked for their
                confirmation.
