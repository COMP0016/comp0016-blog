                Recommender system: A recommender system, or a recommendation
                system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as
                platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering
                system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user
                would give to an item [7]. One approach to the design of
                recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative
                filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption
                that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and
                that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the
                past. The system generates recommendations using only
                information about rating profiles for different users or items.
                By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to
                the current user or item, they generate recommendations using
                this neighborhood.

                Pokémon Go is one of the most famous and earliest AR games, and
                it has similarities with AR part of our project. In Pokémon Go,
                users catch and collect Pokémon under AR mode. It encourages
                users to go out by integrating Google Map API within, so that
                the more places user discovered, the more Pokémon he will
                collect, the more powerful he will be. They can train it by
                having combat with other trainers, interacting with them or
                feeding them to increase intimacy. Likewise, in WAPETS2.0 users
                can interact, play and feed their WAPETs under AR mode, and
                there will be intimacy system and social media integration. Many
                researchers suggests that Pokémon GO reduced anxiety about
                interacting with strangers [8], Pokémon GO increases
                attention-concentration in adolescents and players feel more
                happy than non-players [9], and help to build social
                connectedness through real-world engagement [10]. We have reason
                to hope that WAPETS2.0 can bring such a positive impact to
                society as well.
