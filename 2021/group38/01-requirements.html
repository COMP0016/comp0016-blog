              <hr />
              <h4>Do you live alone?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">Yes</p>
              <h4>Do you live alone?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                I have a regular lunch with some friends once a week, and family
                members stop in occasionally, so one to three times per week.
              </p>
              <h4>How confident are you with technology?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                I think I generally understand what’s going on, but I struggle
                to tap the right bit of my phone screen. I use siri a lot, she
                makes everything a lot easier!
              </p>
              <h4>
                Would you be interested in an AI pet? (The concept was explained
                to him)
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                I don’t think it’s going to be anything like social interaction,
                but I do think it could be a useful tool to make using
                technology easier.
              </p>
              <h4>
                What sort of things would you find most helpful for it to be
                able to do?
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                I think a lot of the things siri can do, like telling me the
                time and playing music, would be nice. But to specifically use
                the fact that the camera is involved, maybe it being able to
                tell me what I’m looking at when I haven’t got my glasses on, or
                reading out text.

              <h3 class="card-title">Interview with nursing home worker</h3>
              <hr />
              <h4>Do you think socialising is important for elderly people?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Yes, humans are social creatures and, particularly for people
                living alone, some kind of regular interaction is important so
                that they don’t forget how!
              </p>
              <h4>
                Do you think any value could be had from interaction with an AI?
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                An AI is obviously not going to be as good as real people, but
                it does still practice the skill of social interaction. Also, if
                they can interact with the internet through an AI interface
                (such as voice commands), it could allow them to connect with
                real people too.
              </p>
              <h4>
                What sort of user interface requirements do you think our users
                might have?
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Different people will have a range of different needs, so it is
                probably best to design a couple of interaction styles. The two
                main considerations I would think of would be sight, and
                hearing. So you probably want any UI elements to be large, and
                sounds to be clear. And you should also be able to interact with
                as much as possible through BOTH visual and auditory methods.
              </p>
              <h4>What functionality would be most useful?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                At it’s most basic, the time, the weather and maybe the news.
                Those are the three things that we are asked about most
                frequently. Beyond that, I would say finding some way to
                interact with family members and then maybe the full internet.

                After conducting our interviews and getting a better
                understanding of our potential user base, we produced several

                requirements with a more holistic approach as we focused not
                only on elderly people but potential users who could be
                unfamiliar in general with smartphones and other related
                technologies.
